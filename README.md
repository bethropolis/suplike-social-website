# getting started

## Installation

#### Requirements

- PHP
- Apache server
- MySQL Database
- phpMyAdmin (optional)

> All of these requirements can be completed at once by simply installing a server stack like `Wamp` or `Xampp` etc.

### Installation Steps

1. Download the latest release file.
  
  | File                                                                                                                          | Description                | Size   |
  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
  | [v1.5.1 zip file](https://github.com/bethropolis/suplike-social-website/releases/download/1.5.1/compressed-suplike-v1.5.1.zip)| Latest release zip file    | 1.4 MB |
  | [v1.5.1 tar file](https://github.com/bethropolis/suplike-social-website/releases/download/1.5.1/compressed-suplike-v1.5.1.tar)| Latest release tar.gz file | 3.0 MB |
  | [v1.5.1 installer-script.php](https://github.com/bethropolis/suplike-social-website/releases/download/1.5.1/installer-script.php)| installer script        | 2 kB   |


 unzip the file and extract all the files into your `htdocs` or `www` directory depending on what you are using. (installer script does this automatically)
   > I recommend renaming the extracted folder to `suplike` (the url will be shorter).


2. if you choose to use the installer script then first you need to download the script into your server folder then run the following command.

```bash
  php installer-script.php
```

<br/>

3. you can clone the repository to your `htdocs` or `www` folder. 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bethropolis/suplike-social-website.git suplike
```

> now you are ready to setup.

## setup and configure database

### using the GUI

the GUI is a nicer interface which will automatically setup the database and create admin account for you easily.

![GUI](_githubasserts/gui.png)
<br>
The GUI should open by default on the first time you run the app. If it doesn't then on the browser navigate to `{HOST_URL}/suplike/inc/setup/`.

on the GUI you insert the credentials to your database and admin account after which you will automatically be logged in as admin.



> please note in the url, replace `suplike` with what you named the folder or the folders name (also remove if the app is on the root directory).
> <br>

### incase GUI doesn't work

1. Edit the `inc/setup/setup.suplike.json` and `inc/setup/env.php` file and set the value of `"setup"` to `false` then reopen the GUI in your browser again.

2. Do it Manually, create a database `suplike` and Import the `suplike.sql` file in the `sql` folder into phpMyAdmin. There is no need for any change in the .sql file. Next, change the following part of code below in the  `inc/setup/env.php`  to the respective database credentials.

```php
 if (!defined('DB_DATABASE'))        define('DB_DATABASE', 'suplike');
 if (!defined('DB_HOST'))            define('DB_HOST','localhost');
 if (!defined('DB_USERNAME'))        define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
 if (!defined('DB_PASSWORD'))        define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
 if (!defined('DB_PORT'))            define('DB_PORT',3306);
```

> you'll also manually have to change you account to admin account in the database.

![Alt text](_githubasserts/messages.png)

in previous version, one of the issues was that the messaging page was just
a page. Live messaging was not well supported and you could not choose who to chat with until
you clicked message on their profile page. But in the new version, the entire code was re writen and the
whole of that is gone, you can chat with the people you follow
and it is more mobile responsive than previous and the only client page that uses Vuejs.
